<h1>Why the Clarinet?</h1>

<h2>Now at this point you are probably wondering, why devote breath to play such a boring looking and apparently simple instrument?</h2>
<div>
<p1>If you have had the unique privilege of being able to play an instrument, and the satisfaction that comes from successfully playing something you value, you probably already know accomplished it makes you feel.</p1>
<p2>If music is something you have not been exposed to during your life, however, one of the easiest and most satisfying instruments to begin on is none other than the B flat clarinet.</p2>
<p3>Its sleek exterior and smooth pitch make it a pleasure to play every time it is picked up.</p3>
<p4>Further, this completely biased author's life would not be the same had they chosen a different instrument instead.</p4>
<p5>By playing the clarinet, I have not found only friends, but have had memorable and fun moments when in its presence.</p5> 
<p6>I implore you, if not the clarinet, please choose another instrument by all means. In the end, it is not the instrument that matters, only the unique experience brought about by playing one!</p6>
