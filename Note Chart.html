<h3></h3>
<h4>Some of the notes beyond middle B flat ( requiring that one put pressure on the 'A' and register keys ) may require that you develop a stronger embouchure, or muscles residing within the mouth or jaw, to play.</h4>
<p1>This is because these notes require a stronger, more direct flow of air to travel through the reed of the clarinet.</p1>
<p2>This, in turn, requires that the player have an especially honed embouchure to produce some of the clarinet's higher pitches.</p2>
<p3>In order to strengthen the embouchure, one must simply play the instrument to the extent where the muscles grow, similarly to how exercise generates muscle. Despite this fact, it is still easily possible to play charming melodies using only lower register keys, or notes below middle B flat.</p3>
<h5>It might also be difficult to play any note at all when using a higher thickness reed.</h5>
<p1>When playing some woodwind instruments, including all variations of saxophone and clarinet, a reed is required to produce any sound at all, that, when blown upon, send out vibrations that help the instrument to produce a sound.</p1>
<p2>However, when choosing a reed, one must consider their experience in their given reed instrument, meaning that less experienced players may want to consider playing a reed size of 2 or 2 1/2.</p2>
<p3>If one finds that their reed size is too high, they may experience extreme difficulty producing a sound, poor tone quality, or a high pitched squeal sure to deafen every one of your poor peers.</p3>
<p4>To prevent this, one need only to carefully select the reed most suited for their skill level, and remember, it won't be embarrassing to play a lower level reed when you are still experienced.</p4>
